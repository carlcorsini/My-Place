# Project Title

####MyPlace

Here you will find my Quarter 1 project from my Galvanize. The goal of this project was to create an interactive web page that stores data in local storage. In this project you will find Javascript, HTML & CSS all written by the author Carl Corsini. The project was meant to focus solely on front-end. It was an exciting project to create because it all started from a blank page. Some problems I came across was having 2 javascript files interacting with each other, and saving the form data when the user returns to the form page. I relied on local storage to store all of the form data and populated the users page with said data.
